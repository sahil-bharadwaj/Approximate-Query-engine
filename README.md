# ML-Powered Approximate Query Engine

An intelligent SQL query optimization system using Machine Learning to provide 3-7x performance improvements on analytical queries.

This Python Flask application uses intelligent sampling strategies and probabilistic data structures to execute approximate queries with controlled error bounds. The system learns from query execution history to adaptively improve its optimization decisions.

## Key Features

**Real-Time Learning & Adaptation**
- Historical performance tracking to improve future optimizations
- Adaptive strategy selection based on actual query performance
- Dynamic confidence scoring based on historical success rates
- Actual speedup measurement with real execution time comparisons

**ML-Based Optimization**
- Intelligent choice between sampling, sketching, and exact execution
- Dual execution modes for comparing ML-optimized vs exact results
- Performance gains of 3-7x on typical analytical queries
- Efficient ROWID modulo sampling with minimal overhead

**Error Control & Monitoring**
- Bootstrap-based confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification
- Real-time display of confidence ranges and error bounds
- Configurable error tolerance (typically 1-5%)
- Detailed explanations of optimization decisions

**Deployment & Interface**
- Integrated web UI with responsive design
- Single Python application with no build steps required
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- Real-time performance monitoring and metrics

## Example Usage

Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchases` (200K rows dataset)

**ML Optimized Result:**
- Actual Speedup: 5.2x
- ML Time: 28 ms
- Exact Time: 145 ms
- Estimated Error: 2.1%

The system automatically chooses between sampling strategies, probabilistic sketches, or exact execution based on query characteristics and learned performance patterns.

## Quick Start

**Using Quick Start Scripts:**

Windows:
```cmd
start.bat
```

Linux/Mac:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

**Manual Setup:**

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Generate sample data:
```bash
python seed.py 200000
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

**Docker Deployment:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Requirements: Python 3.8+ or Docker

**Testing the System:**

1. Open the web interface at http://localhost:8080
2. Enter a query like `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchases`
3. Click "Run ML Optimized" to see optimized execution
4. Click "Run Exact" to compare with baseline performance
5. View actual speedup measurements and execution times

## Supported Query Types

**Good Performance (3-7x speedup):**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(amount) FROM purchases;
SELECT country, COUNT(*) FROM purchases GROUP BY country;
SELECT AVG(amount) FROM purchases;
```

#     "strategy": "exact",
#     "confidence": 0.6,
#     "estimated_speedup": 1,
#     "estimated_error": 0,
#     "reasoning": "No clear optimization strategy found - using exact computation for safety (No historical data available)",
#     "transformations": []

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sql": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM purchases", 
    "use_ml_optimization": false
  }'
```

# Approximate Query Engine

## Overview

The Approximate Query Engine is a prototype system designed to deliver fast, analytical insights on massive datasets by trading off a small amount of accuracy for significant speed gains. It leverages techniques such as sampling, probabilistic sketches, and streaming summaries to process queries like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` at least 3x faster than traditional exact methods.

## Motivation

Modern businesses generate enormous volumes of data every second. For many analytical tasks, users care more about trends and patterns than exact numbers. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) enables rapid decision-making by providing "good enough" answers in seconds, not minutes or hours.

## Features

- **SQL-like Analytical Queries:** Supports `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`.
- **Approximate Results:** Uses sampling and sketching to balance speed and accuracy.
- **Tunable Accuracy:** Users can configure accuracy-speed trade-offs.
- **Benchmarking:** Includes tools to compare speed and accuracy against exact methods.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Configure the engine:** Set parameters in the `config.yaml` file.
4. **Submit queries:** Use the provided interface to run SQL-like queries.

## Techniques Used

- **Sampling:** Processes a subset of data to estimate results.
- **Probabilistic Sketches:** Data structures (e.g., HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch) for fast, memory-efficient approximations.
- **Streaming Summaries:** Maintains running aggregates for real-time analytics.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks demonstrate the trade-off between speed and accuracy. See the `benchmarks/` folder for scripts and results comparing approximate vs. exact query performance.

## Configuration

- **Accuracy Target:** Set desired accuracy (e.g., 95%) in the config file or via command-line arguments.
- **Performance Tuning:** Adjust sampling rates and sketch parameters for optimal speed.

## Stretch Goals

- **Real-time Analytics:** Support for streaming queries on live data.
- **Visualization/UI:** Simple interface to compare approximate and exact results.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` folder, including:
- Explanation of approximation techniques
- API reference
- Usage examples
