# Approximate Query Engine

## Overview

The Approximate Query Engine is a prototype system designed to deliver fast, analytical insights on massive datasets by trading off a small amount of accuracy for significant speed gains. It leverages techniques such as sampling, probabilistic sketches, and streaming summaries to process queries like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` at least 3x faster than traditional exact methods.

## Motivation

Modern businesses generate enormous volumes of data every second. For many analytical tasks, users care more about trends and patterns than exact numbers. Approximate Query Processing (AQP) enables rapid decision-making by providing "good enough" answers in seconds, not minutes or hours.

## Features

- **SQL-like Analytical Queries:** Supports `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`.
- **Approximate Results:** Uses sampling and sketching to balance speed and accuracy.
- **Tunable Accuracy:** Users can configure accuracy-speed trade-offs.
- **Benchmarking:** Includes tools to compare speed and accuracy against exact methods.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
2. **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Configure the engine:** Set parameters in the `config.yaml` file.
4. **Submit queries:** Use the provided interface to run SQL-like queries.

## Techniques Used

- **Sampling:** Processes a subset of data to estimate results.
- **Probabilistic Sketches:** Data structures (e.g., HyperLogLog, Count-Min Sketch) for fast, memory-efficient approximations.
- **Streaming Summaries:** Maintains running aggregates for real-time analytics.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks demonstrate the trade-off between speed and accuracy. See the `benchmarks/` folder for scripts and results comparing approximate vs. exact query performance.

## Configuration

- **Accuracy Target:** Set desired accuracy (e.g., 95%) in the config file or via command-line arguments.
- **Performance Tuning:** Adjust sampling rates and sketch parameters for optimal speed.

## Stretch Goals

- **Real-time Analytics:** Support for streaming queries on live data.
- **Visualization/UI:** Simple interface to compare approximate and exact results.

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` folder, including:
- Explanation of approximation techniques
- API reference
