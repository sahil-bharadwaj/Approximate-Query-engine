# Design Document: Approximate Query Engine

## 1. Overview

The Approximate Query Engine is designed to provide fast, analytical insights on large datasets by trading off a small amount of accuracy for significant speed gains. It supports SQL-like queries (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`) and allows users to choose between exact and approximate results.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Components

- **Web Interface (Flask):**
  - Allows users to upload data (CSV or database).
  - Provides forms for query submission and displays results.

- **Data Loader (`data_loader.py`):**
  - Loads data from CSV files or connects to databases via SQLAlchemy.
  - Returns a Pandas DataFrame for processing.

- **Query Processor (`query_processor.py`):**
  - Implements exact and approximate query algorithms.
  - Uses sampling, sketches, or streaming summaries for approximation.

- **Engine (`engine.py`):**
  - Orchestrates data loading and query processing.
  - Exposes a unified interface for running queries.

## 3. Data Flow

1. **User uploads data** (CSV or database URI) via the web interface.
2. **Data Loader** loads the data into a DataFrame.
3. **User submits a query** (type, column, mode, accuracy).
4. **Engine** calls the Query Processor for either exact or approximate results.
5. **Results are displayed** on the web interface.

## 4. Approximation Techniques

- **Sampling:** Randomly selects a subset of data for faster computation.
- **Probabilistic Sketches:** Uses data structures like HyperLogLog or Count-Min Sketch for fast, memory-efficient approximations.
- **Streaming Summaries:** Maintains running aggregates for real-time analytics.

---

## 5. Extensibility

- **Database Support:** Easily add support for more databases by extending the Data Loader.
- **Query Types:** Add more analytical queries by updating the Query Processor.
- **Accuracy Tuning:** Users can adjust sampling rates or sketch parameters for desired accuracy/speed trade-off.

---

## 6. Benchmarking

- **Benchmark scripts** compare speed and accuracy of approximate vs. exact queries.
- Results are documented for different dataset sizes and accuracy settings.
